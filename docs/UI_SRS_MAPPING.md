| UI Element                        | Description from UI Spec                                     | Related SRS Feature                    | Description from SRS                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Header Layout**                 | Fixed top bar (64px height) with logo, title "Admin POS", tabs (e.g., Dine In), and user profile (avatar, name "Admin Daboy", role "Cashier 01"). | Admin Dashboard & Authentication       | Cloud backend includes admin dashboard with auth (JWT); user profile implies cashier login for order management and reporting. |
| **Left Sidebar**                  | 240px width, sections like "Sales Analytic 5" with icon/badge, and scrollable order tabs showing order number, item count, status (e.g., Ready to serve). | KDS Integration & Order Status Updates | WebSocket for KDS and clients to push new orders and status changes (e.g., in-progress to ready); order tabs reflect real-time local orders and statuses. |
| **Main Content**                  | Flexible area with header "Menu Items (51)" including search, category tabs (e.g., All Menu), and 3-column grid of menu item cards (image, name, price, add button). | Menu Serving & Local API               | Local server exposes GET /local/menu to serve menu JSON; PWA loads menu for selection, supporting offline caching via service worker. |
| **Right Sidebar (Order Summary)** | 320px width, with "Order's Summary" header, item list (thumbnail, name, qty, price, trash icon), payment summary (key-value pairs, total), and "Place Order" button. | Order Placement & Offline Storage      | Optimistic UI for order submission: POST to /local/orders, store in IndexedDB queue if offline; items and totals match order payload schema. |
| **Menu Item Cards**               | 300x320px cards with top image, name, price, and button (e.g., "Add Item" or counter); hover effects and clickable areas. | Item Selection & Dynamic Behavior      | User flow for adding items to cart; real-time updates to summary without reload, aligning with PWA's IndexedDB for local persistence. |
| **Buttons (e.g., Place Order)**   | Full-width primary button (48px height, blue background); secondary buttons for add/choose; states like hover/active. | Order Submission & Idempotency         | Triggers POST with clientOrderId and idempotencyKey; local server accepts and persists, providing immediate acknowledgement for optimistic UX. |
| **Status Pills/Badges**           | Colored pills (e.g., green for "Ready to serve", orange for in-progress) in order tabs. | Order Status & WebSocket Notifications | KDS updates status via WebSocket; local server broadcasts changes to clients for real-time UI updates. |
| **Search Input**                  | In main header, 200px input with magnifier icon for filtering menu items. | Menu Filtering                         | Local menu endpoint supports querying; offline-first design ensures cached menu can be filtered client-side. |
| **Icons (e.g., Trash, Close)**    | 20-24px icons for remove item, close summary; colored (red for trash). | Item Management & Confirmation Modals  | Dynamic behaviors like delete confirmation; aligns with UX for cart modifications before submission. |
| **Payment Summary**               | Bottom section with totals, method (implied cash/card), right-aligned values. | Payments Integration                   | Payment object in order payload (method: cash/card, status: pending); supports offline cash marking, with reconciliation in admin. |
| **Responsive Design**             | Breakpoints for tablet/mobile: stack sidebars, adjust grid columns, increase button sizes for touch. | PWA & Mobile Optimization              | PWA served via local hotspot; captive portal for mobile devices; ensures usability on phones/tablets for onsite ordering. |
| **Animations & Interactions**     | Hover scales, transitions; real-time updates on add/remove; modals for confirmations. | Optimistic UI & Sync Guarantees        | At-least-once delivery with retries; optimistic acceptance shows immediate feedback (e.g., "Accepted locally"), with sync status updates. |
| **Accessibility Features**        | ARIA labels for icons, focus outlines, tab navigation.       | General UX Requirements                | Ensures inclusive design; aligns with SRS emphasis on reliable user flows in restaurant environments. |
